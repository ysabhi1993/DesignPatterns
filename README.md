# DesignPatterns
Software design patterns implementation

### SOLID Design Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle: A class should only have one reason to change
* Open-Closed Principle: Systems should be open for extention and closed for modification (use Specification Pattern).
* Liskov Substitution Principle: Design should work as expected when Base class is substituted with Derived class.
* Interface Segregation Principle: Do not have large interfaces forcing implementations for unnecessary methods.
* Dependency Inversion Principle: Protects from changes in implementation details 
    1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules and instead depend on abstractions
    2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
